This is the source code for my personal portfolio site. The site includes 3
pages: Home, About, Portfolio. The `Home` page displays my social links.
Visitors can download a copy of my resume from the `About` page. The `Portfolio`
page hosts some of the projects I have built in my free time. You can get in
touch with me by sending mail.
